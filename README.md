# My First Remote Repo

This is my first remote repo.

It started life as a local git repository.

But you'll be able to read this on GitHub when we put it onto a GitHub remote!

I just made a change!
I'm going to add a little bit about myself. My name is Temi and I like pizza. How about you?
I'm editing this in Nano, how cool is that!
